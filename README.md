# Book A Meal :pizza:
This is the Andela Book-A-Meal web project challenge. 

**Note**: This repository is managed through the PivotalTracker project 
[here](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2165567). 

This GitHub repository has also been integrated with that PivotalTracker 
project and on every commit, there will be an id to the story being worked on.

## Introduction
The project entails having a caterer as the site administrator and can add 
meals to the application as well as set menus for a particular day. 
The customers, after signing up first, are then allowed to book meals online.

## The Client Side
This is the frontend part of the application and will involve building from 
the ground up a user interface without the use of UI frontend frameworks such 
as Bootstrap or Foundation. 

The color palette was generated using [coolors.co](https://coolors.co) which 
is a tool for generating non-crashing colors.

The wireframes are built using [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/).

### Color Palette

### Pages
We will now tackle the development process page by page:

#### Landing Page
This will be the first page any user of the application will land on. 
The following is the the wireframe of this page:

From here the user can either choose to login or sign up as well as see some 
of the menus available for that particular day.
